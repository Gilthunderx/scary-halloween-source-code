Thank you for downloading my plugin ScaryHalloween.

In this folder you find the .jar-file, which is currently
only available for Spigot 1.8.X, because of many sounds and
effects. I am working hard to make the plugin available for more
versions like: 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and eventually 1.13

Also I have translated the plugin into German. If you need the German version
just paste the german_config.yml into the ScaryHalloween folder on your server,
delete the old one and rename it to config.yml.

Have lots of fun and a happy halloween with this plugin,
PXAV - Developer :)
